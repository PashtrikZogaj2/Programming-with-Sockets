📜 Project Description:
This project provides a comprehensive socket programming, covering the essentials of establishing client-server communication, exchanging data, and closing connections in a controlled manner. Socket programming forms the backbone of network communication, enabling applications to send and receive data across local and wide-area networks.

🚀 The project covers:

Setting up client-server models
Managing UDP connections
Ensuring safe data transmission and error handling
Designing a scalable and reusable codebase for socket applications
The code is designed to be accessible and adaptable for students and developers interested in network programming.


🛠 Results:
The project successfully demonstrates a basic yet powerful socket communication setup. Users can run both UDP examples to understand different protocols, observing how data is transmitted and received in real-time. This is a practical implementation for learning network communication, with a structured codebase that is easy to expand.

🎓 Expectations:
This project serves as a learning tool for students and network enthusiasts. It allows for hands-on experimentation with sockets, providing insights into client-server relationships, real-time communication, and network error handling. The code can be extended for more advanced networking projects, laying the groundwork for future applications.
