📜 Project Description
This project provides a detailed exploration of socket programming, focusing on the fundamentals of establishing client-server communication, managing data exchange, and handling connections securely. Socket programming is a crucial component of network communication, enabling applications to transmit and receive data across both local and wide-area networks.

🚀 Project Highlights
Client-Server Models: Set up and manage client-server architectures.
UDP Connections: Implement and monitor UDP-based communication.
Data Transmission & Error Handling: Ensure reliable data transfer with error handling.
Scalable Codebase: Design a reusable and adaptable code foundation for socket applications.
The codebase is structured for ease of understanding, making it accessible for students and developers interested in network programming.

🛠 Results
This project effectively demonstrates a foundational yet robust setup for socket-based communication. Users can run UDP examples to observe data transmission and reception in real-time, enhancing their grasp of networking protocols. The code is designed to support further expansion, making it suitable for more advanced networking projects.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
This project is an educational tool for students and network enthusiasts, providing hands-on experience with sockets. It offers insights into client-server dynamics, real-time data exchange, and network error management. The codebase can be extended for advanced applications, laying a solid foundation for future projects.
